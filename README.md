# How to use git
**To upload files to GitHub you have to use these commands in the terminal**
1.  Go into terminal
2.  Go to the directory that you want to make the commit
3.  Then just use the command line that I wrote down here 
```command.md
git init
git add README.md
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/userName/repoName.git
git push --force origin master
```
